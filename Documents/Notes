    Setting: Mineral Mining, Plant Growing, Alloy Melting, Cook Serve Delicious
    With high attention meter place have surveilance
    - get money from Companies for doing Quest (money changes if workers are unionized, work is more rentable if much union)
    - steal
    - sabotage
    - be lazy
    - repair
