------------------------------------------
----- Ideas ------------------------------
------------------------------------------
- Grind mechanic
    Daily needs:
        Sleep -> based on time like in StardewVallay, but with night encounter. Better bed increases skills, also Kuschis
        Food -> Eat during game (if not eaten for days, dies)
        Air -> needed for space suit
        Medicine -> needed if ill
        Entertainment -> maybe useless but nice value
    Achievements like personal capsule/room with own furniture help, can also be public like community center with benefits
        => Tutorial just food, then live in container, then lend capsule, then room. (maybe also secret hideouts)
    Go to work as freelancer (there are always quests, you decide if you are a good worker)
    Setting: Mineral Mining, Plant Growing, Alloy Melting, Cook Serve Delicious
    With high attention meter place have surveilance
    - get money from Companies for doing Quest (money changes if workers are unionized, work is more rentable if much union)
    - steal
    - sabotage to increase chaos, create work or change behavior
    - be lazy to get job over multiple days
    - repair
    - scavenge/search with game as coin game variant
    Public Work (Revolutionary meter, needed for main questline or acsess to areas due to people that feel more safe with helping you)
    - Spray, Flugzettel
    - Gain trust through dailies like provide food/water/communication between people
- Management Attention meter shows how strong security is. (if security is high you are also suspicious)
    - increases if machine broken, item stolen, propaganda
        if high: closed doors, guards, interogation and punishment, game end, less items
    - decreases
        over time
        by actions like deleting logs or bestechen
        higher decrease/lower increase if station under stress, chaos mode
        quest of company succeeded (you can be slow to get paid every day)
    - neutral
        scavenging dump, unknown items

- Revolutionary Spirit meter shows how strong people want change, increases with lower living standard, pamphlets against companies, or if they trust you.
- Increasable Skills like Sabotage (Harm Machines), Craft (Tools/Weapons/Propaganda), Rethorik
- Gewerkschaft is corrupted, helps worker but ignores slaves; but unionization helps for more money from quest work
- Social Game also technical
    - influence on time/speed
    - tricolon as copy visible coins
    - areas that double reward
- Character Flaws
    - not confident if can make
- Verbindung, Social layers
    -> Drugs, Spirituality
    -> Gay
    -> Hobbies
- Company is private autocracy; factions within "government"
    - Earth Defenders want to save earth, bad conditions are needed to fulfill production, no risk acceptable
    - Red Faction wants better conditions, egoistic, risk is ok. Earth supply may jeopardized
    - Indepence/Union movement wants Earth to pay, bit more equal but Feudal
- Robot Avatars, remote control
- Tragik der Allmende
- Verteilungslogik: Egalitär, Utilitaristisch
- Die die seit sie geboren wurden niemals Mangel an etwas hatten, hasste ich immer
- Traitors that interacts with multiple roles, but you dont know that they are the same
- Different suites
    space suit for outer world and water pipe
    other uniforms to get access to areas
- Textbox die mit dem Spieler mitgeht als Lautsprecher
- Input line secrets, enter number or names
- Schuldsklaven "Verbrecher" vom sYstem absichtlich produziert
- Main menu with dark parts that get light abwechseln, reveal hammer/sickle, Money, such things
- Social Assignment mechanic
- Minigames: Minesweeper, Einarmiger Bandit, test knowledge with symbols or inputs
- espionage/desinformation via Alexa devices
- Why are people poor? Donations from rich are stupid. System is not fair, we had never a change

    Other Tec Collegue: I will do it for 15. - Is there a better offer?
    [You bet 13]
    Other Tec Collegue: I will do it for 10. - Are you crazy? - 1-2-3 given to other Tec Collegue, no work for you today. Go back to Crewdeck
    Other Tec I need the money today, yesterday you got the job.
Second collegue at crew deck:
    Hmmph, those criminals always tell us this is a fair, there is simply not enough work to do!
    But we can get some food elsewhere => The Housekeeper schuldet mir ein Favor, talk to him, he will let you in.
    I will have an argument about my contract with the tenderer!
Housekeeper explains MAM, lets you in, you can get food.
    => If you take few nobody will care very much, but if you take to much they will react
    Bring food to medicine guy, lets sleep with characterisation history
Next day go to tenderer, on way you see Security at Doctor capsule
    Interagate, depentend to MAM, but nothing happens
Impact of meteorit

        Leaking, need material, report back
    2) Other Tec check People capsule

    3) Medicine, also check people capsule
    => Check machine room for supplies, not enough
    => Decision to furniture, People not insured but "life important supplies"
    (Other tec is at the life systems to check)
Medic approaches you, tells you that there are humans and you have to decide if you really want to complete the quest.
Its enough chaos, MaM doesnt fill that much if there is chaos, door emergency unlocked, get access to life support and storage
Optionally: Ask sec Tec for Space suit and harvest broken capsule, give him part
    => Humans, no money and fired
    => Furniture, money, you get fired for fixing "the wrong one"

QUEST 2:
You sleep in a container, you have nothing, start an existance by quests and steal, you are a immigrant
